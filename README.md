# coffeeMachine
JetBrains Academy java Project. There are not much commits because the project has been made on IntelliJ and the progress has been tracked by JetBrains Academy

The project is a virtual coffee machine manager. It tracks the amount of ingredients left, and tracks the sales. After Work, it gives the profit to the manager

I just wanted to add the project to my gitHub so that I can track the projects I made.
